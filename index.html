      <P class="para">Dont you hate the guessing game that comes with buying a new saddle?</br></br>

        If youre here, you either have a bin full of saddles that have been tested unsuccessfully, or youve got the same saddle on all your bikes (n+1!) because youre too scared to try something new.</br></br>

        Hopefully this site can give you some options that will fit your butt type.</P>

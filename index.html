        Dont you hate the guessing game that comes with buying a new saddle?

        If youre here, you either have a bin full of saddles that have been tested unsuccessfully, or youve got the same saddle on all your bikes (n+1!) because youre too scared to try something new.

        Hopefully this site can give you some options that will fit your butt type.

        Check out <a href="this subpage" fitguide.html> for some thought morsels from Sheldon Brown.

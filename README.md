SaddleSelector
SaddleSelector is an encyclopedia of bicycle seat data (referred to as saddles in the industry). The market is filled with many sizes, shapes, makes and attributes of saddles, and data is difficult to come by - let alone get an idea of comparing apples with apples.

BC (Before Covid), some bike shops would allow you to borrow "testers" to let you get an idea, however it is difficult to see this continuing from a hygiene perspective.

This idea is inspired by WhatBars.com - a similar concept for handlebars, however its lacking a lot of features which I intend to fill.

Data will initially be catalogued from two manufacturers for the proof of concept, with further brands added in subsequent projects (if it makes sense)

# SaddleSelector does:
<ol>
	<li>Initial landing page explaining the purpose of the site and contents</li>
	<li>Seat data page, bootstrap grid model</li>
	<li>How to choose a seat, text will be sourced from Sheldon Brown and sufficient credit given. Allows to use IDS, classes and lists.</li>
	<li>Details about rail types</li>
</ol>
</P>
